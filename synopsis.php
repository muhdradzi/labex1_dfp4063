    Once upon a time there was a very rich man who lived with his three daughters.
    The two older daughters laughed at anyone who did not dress as well as they did.
    If they were not going to a ball, they were shopping for as many fine dresses and
    hats as they could carry home.
    </br>

    <br>
    The youngest daughter, Beauty, liked to read most of all. “No one will want you!”
    her two older sisters said, and they laughed. “Look at your hair - you look like a
    servant girl!” Beauty did not know why they talked to her in a mean way. But she
    said nothing.
    </br>

    <br>
    One day, the father got some very bad news. He had spent all of his money on a ship
    that he sent out to sea for trade. Now he learned that the ship was gone. Everything
    on it was lost! All at once, the rich father became as poor as poor could be.
    </br>

    <br>
    The family could no longer stay in their big house. The house, its fine tables and
    chairs, and all of their fine things, had to be sold.
    </br>

    <br>
    All the father had left was a little hut deep in the woods. So that is where he and
    his three daughters had to move. Living in the hut in the woods was hard work. Each
    day a fire had to be started, meals cooked, the place cleaned up, the garden tended,
    and things fixed when they broke. Now that the family was poor, you might think the
    two older sisters would help out with the chores. Think again.
    </br>

    <br>
    “She looks like such a mess,” they said, turning up their noses at Beauty. “She might
    as well serve us.” And so Beauty did all the hard work.
    </br>

    <br>
    And then – good news! – the father’s ship came to shore!
    </br>

    <br>
    “Daughters,” said the happy father, “I am going to town. Tell me what fine gift I can
    bring back for you.”
    </br>

    <br>
    “Bring me the finest dress from the finest shop,” said the eldest sister.
    </br>

    <br>
    “I want one just like it,” said the middle sister.
    </br>

    <br>
    “And you, Beauty?” said he.
    </br>

    <br>
    “All I want, Father,” said she, “is a single rose.”
    </br>

    <br>
    “Can you believe her?” said the eldest sister.
    </br>

    <br>
    “What a fool!” said the middle sister. They both laughed.
